# Global Plan for SQL Query Agent Project

## Specialized Protocols for SQL Query Generation

1. **SELECT Queries Only**
   - Limit to SELECT statements for data retrieval
   - No DDL (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
   - No DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - No DCL (GRANT, REVOKE)
   - Avoid SELECT * - specify columns explicitly for better performance

2. **Query Construction Rules**
   - Always start with SELECT
   - Apply LIMIT for result size control (warning user)

3. **Metadata**
   - Show number of rows returned
   - Provide query explanation


## 2. Feature Task Tracking System

### A. Task Tracking Overview
1. **Core Features**
   - Real-time tracking of natural language to SQL conversion
   - Performance monitoring and timing metrics
   - Session-based task history
   - User experience analytics

2. **Tracked Information**
   - Natural language input timestamp
   - SQL generation timestamp and duration
   - SQL execution timestamp and performance
   - Query results and success status
   - Retry attempts and error handling

3. **Two-Stage Process Tracking**
   - **Stage 1: Natural Language to SQL Generation**
     - Timestamp when user enters natural language query
     - Duration to generate SQL query from natural language
     - Timestamp when SQL query is ready for execution
   
   - **Stage 2: SQL Query Execution**
     - Timestamp when SQL execution begins
     - Duration to execute SQL query and return results
     - Timestamp when results are available to user
   
   - **Stage Transition Metrics**
     - Time from NL input to SQL generation completion
     - Time from SQL generation to execution start
     - Total end-to-end processing time

### B. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Tracking Infrastructure
1. **Basic Tracking**
   - Timestamp recording for all query phases
   - Session-based task storage
   - Performance measurement utilities

2. **Integration Points**
   - Natural language input processing
   - SQL query generation
   - Query execution and results

#### Phase 2: User Interface Integration
1. **Real-time Display**
   - Show timestamps in chat interface
   - Display execution duration
   - Add progress indicators
   - Show retry attempts

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Query generation time
   - SQL execution time
   - Total processing time
   - Success/failure rates

#### Phase 3: Analytics and Insights
1. **Data Collection**
   - Monitor system performance

2. **Reporting Features**
   - Performance dashboards
   - Usage analytics
   - Error rate monitoring

### C. User Experience Enhancements

#### 1. Real-time Feedback
- **Input Phase**: Show "Processing natural language..." with timestamp
- **Generation Phase**: Display "Generating SQL query..." with duration
- **Execution Phase**: Show "Executing query..." with progress
- **Results Phase**: Display complete metrics and timestamps

#### 2. Performance Indicators
- **Speed Metrics**: Show processing time for each phase
- **Success Indicators**: Visual feedback for successful operations
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with timing information
- **Retry Logic**: Show retry attempts and reasons

#### 3. Analytics Dashboard
- **Session Summary**: Total queries, average response time
- **Performance Trends**: Query generation vs execution time
- **Error Analysis**: Common failure patterns and solutions
- **Usage Statistics**: Peak usage times and query patterns

### D. Data Storage and Persistence

#### 1. Session Storage
- Store tracking data in Streamlit session state
- Maintain task history for current session
- Enable real-time access to tracking information

#### 2. Persistent Storage (Future)
- SQLite database for historical data
- JSON file storage for analytics
- Export capabilities for data analysis

#### 3. Privacy and Security
- Anonymize user data for analytics
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Compliance with data protection regulations

### E. Monitoring and Alerting

#### 1. Performance Thresholds
- Set maximum acceptable response times
- Monitor error rates and patterns
- Alert on system performance degradation

#### 2. Quality Metrics
- Track query generation success rate
- Monitor SQL execution success rate
- Measure user satisfaction indicators

#### 3. System Health
